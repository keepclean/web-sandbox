        <h1>Interneting is hard!</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of you site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>This is how you make an unordered list</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>And each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is what an ordered list looks like</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
            <li>But, the list item elemtnts are the same</li>
            <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
            <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is and ordered list</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
        <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word  or phrase.
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</em></strong></p>

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

        <p>Thanks for reading! Internetin should be getting easier now.</p>
        <p>Regards,<br>
